# Learning WebScraping Demo

A small hobby project where I practice web scraping using **Python**, **Requests**, and **BeautifulSoup**.  
This is just me exploring how to fetch and organize data from websites for fun and learning.

## What This Does

This script scrapes book data (title, price, stock, and link) from  
Books to Scrape - (https://books.toscrape.com) — a safe website made for practicing web scraping.

It loops through all pages automatically and saves the results into a CSV file.

# notes

This is purely a learning demo — the website used is meant for practice.
I’m using this project to slowly understand how scraping, data handling, and automation work in Python.
Hoping to make this to a real project.
